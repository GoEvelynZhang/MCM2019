public evacuation plan based on network flow
#### Introduction
When an emergency occurs in a closed public space, its devastating effect can take thousands of lives away, causing considerable losses to public wealth. However, in most cases, the occurrence of an emergency is not the sentence to death but the poor emergency management and reaction mechanism. The chaos caused by the panic crowds fleeing in all directions can hinder the evacuation process and may block the way for the emergency personnel to get to the scene, carrying out their work. As a result, an effective and dedicated emergency evacuation plan should be designed for any public spaces, ensuring efficient responses that can help to minimize the losses.

Instead of considering individual choices of evacuation route, we primarily look at the evacuation plan from a macro perspective and think the personnel involved as a whole. We model the evacuation process by comparing it to the flow of networks. By analyzing the similarities and differences between our evacuation model and the typical flow network model,
 we make some adjustments to the flow network model and work out our evacuation model .
Then we start testing it on multiple scenarios, adjusting models accordingly with emphasizing on more detailed features. Further, we examine our model with the occurrence of random unexpected events, e.g., the existence of visitors with mobility difficulties, obstruction of evacuation routes. Our model eventually proves to have a real-time self-adjustment mechanism towards those unexpected situations and is robust in achieving its designed goal of minimizing the total evacuation time against any changes. We take the exact data from the Louvre as a test and analysis of our model and we also find this modelâ€™s general applicability to any crowded, public structure.

#### Assumptions
* People are rational during the whole evacuation process and only follow the designated evacuation route as assigned
* People are generally viewed as being able to understand and follow the instructions from the security
* Each visitor moves at a consistent speed during the whole evacuation process
* People generally follow orders for evacuation
* We prioritize the evacuation by how close the rooms are from where the emergency happens as well as the depth of the room from the exit
* People always take the route away from where the emergency happens
* Hallways are modeled as rooms with same flow capacity in both ways
* We prioritize the evacuation of visitors inside the museum in our model

#### Model specification 
The flow of crowds in an evacuation can be analogous to the flow network, which is a well- established model. Two inputs are required in this model, one is the flow network and the other is the ways that networks are connected. However, there exist some differences between the model we establish and the typical flow network model. In the typical flow network model, there are both inflow and outflow of people. Nevertheless, in the case of our evacuation model, though people can move in between the exhibition rooms, there is no inflow of people. At this point, we would like to keep evacuation personnel outside of our discussion, which we would address later.
#### Model test by Louvre

This improvised model adopts the same logic of flow network as it is before, but by bring in the real-time quantified monitor on the remaining people in each evacuating room, it constantly rerun the previous model and brings the best route of evacuation at real-time. So each time with the rerunning, we would see a brand-new evacuation route. Now using the data we assigned for each flow network capacity, we regenerate the simulation with the additional estimate of the number of people in each room (Figure 10). In this simulation, we assume in the total 30 rooms, each has 200 people. So at the beginning of the evacuation, there are in total 6000 people in the Louvre. And the change of people inside the museum is plotted as the following applying the new model. The total amount of time for evacuation is 423s.

#### Extending to general model
Although in the previous test cases, we only tested several specific cases including the Louvre, this model can be used much extensively. To be more precise, this model can be generally applicable to the evacuation plan of any public, crowded places with the following features:
* Any buildings, halls, or outdoor structures can be described by network models (can be described by structure of vertices and edges).
* The flow capacity of each edges are known or are able to be estimated.
* There exists accountable exits connected in the network.
* The amount of people in each vertex (or room) is known or able to be estimated.

#### Sensitivity Test
In our previous model established, we consider a constant flow capacity for each network during the evacuation. However, in a real-life situation, unexpectancy happens such as disabled or injured people blocking the way, partial falling down of the ceiling, or multiple such events happening which would influence the flow capacity. We want to know how the total amount of evacuation time would fluctuate with the shift in flow capacity. To take the most cases into consideration, we here cover the following scenarios.
* Multiple change of flow capacity is considered
* Duration of each change of flow capacity is considered
* When each change of flow capacity happen is considered
* How much each flow capacity change is considered.

In order to run the sensitivity test, we give the following assumptions and set ranges for each variables we consider that may affect the optimal time for evacuation
* Each flow network has a 1% possibility of running into a flow capacity constraint situation
* The duration of each flow capacity constraint is any random integer in the range of 10- 30s
* The time for each flow capacity constraint is any random non-negative integer
* The parameter for the change of each flow capacity is any random number in the
range of 0.05-0.3

Below are two graphs showing the fluctuation of evacuation according to random parameters as listed above after running the algorithm 100 times and 1000 times (Figure 11).
